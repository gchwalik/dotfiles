# Dotfiles 

This repo contains my permanent dotfiles and a clean-OS setup script, so I don't have to deal with configuring my computer on fresh installs (which I do semi-frequently).

## Installation

To run install effectively, copy the `install-git.sh` script to local, run, then run `install.sh` with the following command:
```
sudo -E ./scripts/install.sh
```

## Note

When making changes to this script, make sure that the remote url is set to ssh.
You'll probably need to run the install script first, to get your ssh set up.

## Todos
