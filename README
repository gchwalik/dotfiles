# Dotfiles 

This repo contains my permanent dotfiles and a clean-OS setup script, so I don't have to deal with configuring my computer on fresh installs (which I do semi-frequently).

## Installation

To run install effectively, copy the `install-git.sh` script to local, run, then run `install.sh` with the following command:
```
sudo -E ./install.sh
```

## Not Covered by Script
- reverse scroll direction (depends on OS)
- login to Chrome (login page opened by script though)
- login to Dropbox and starting sync (dropbox launch after install though)
- add Dropbox to File Manager Bookmarks (can't do programmatically)
- change Security on keepass to allow double-click on user+pass (easiest to do manually)
- set VS Code preferences (easiest to do manually)
